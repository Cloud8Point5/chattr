Chattr
======

Chattr is a language for writing complex branching dialogue and scripted
experiences for video games. It's built for the Godot engine,
and has an editor addon to make editing dialogue a cinch.

Don't know where to start? Check out the :doc:`getting_started` section
for help with navigating the editor, as well as writing your first Chattr Script.
